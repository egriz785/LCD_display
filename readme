Some changes that I had to make to get this all to work:

1) Moved to spidev0.0, which means I changed GPIO pins from the version in the book:
  SPI1_CS0  (p9.28) -> SPI0_CS0  (p9.17)
  SPI1_D1   (p9.30) -> SPI0_D1   (p9.18)
  SPI1_SCLK (p9.31) -> SPI0_SCLK (p9.22)

2) Changed how the classes are built:
  He was using .so (shared object) and .a (static libraries) files, but they kept throwing errors so I just copied the relevant files from
  exploringBB/library/display and exploringBB/library/bus instead, that made it much easier
  This also means you have to upload the build file, I didn't touch the build_static one so don't run that, it doesn't work

Other than that, everything works great!
